user message protocol is a protocol handles reliable data transmission over udp.

feartures:
	use sequence number to identify the packet to send
	acknowledge the packet received
	retransmission on timeouts
	compute and verify checksum
	full dumplex
	support simultaneous connect/close
	flow control: sliding window
	congestion control: slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmission and recovery
	silly window syndrome handling: delayed ack, active window detection
	rtt computation: ack of a retransmitted packet doesn't contribute to the estimated rtt
	state machine: closed->connectiing->established->closing->closed

required platform and libraries:
	Windows
	glib2
	Microsoft C runtime

todo:
	more tests
	improve reliability
	support IPv6
	support Linux
	profiling and optimizing
