user message protocol is a protocol handles reliable data transmission over udp.

feartures:
use sequence number to identify the packet to send
acknowledge the packet received
retransmission on timeouts
compute and verify checksum
flow control: sliding window
congestion control: slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmission and recovery
silly window syndrome handling: delayed ack, active window detection
rtt computation: ack of a retransmitted packet doesn't contribute to the estimated rtt.
